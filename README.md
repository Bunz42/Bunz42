Hey, welcome to the great @Bunz42's GitHub profile! ʕ •ᴥ•ʔ
I'm a 3rd year student at [St. Andrew's College](https://www.sac.on.ca/#)

I know you're probably here to stalk me so here's a curated list of some hobbies I enjoy: 
- I am a junior developer who programs primarily in java.
- Music is great (I play piano and clarinet and I like KPop).
- I am a badminton player (obviously the best and most difficult sport).
- Video games (I like to have a little fun) ヽ༼ຈل͜ຈ༽ﾉ

Here's my favorite living organism in the entire:
